# myclippings

This piece of software was written to aid the collection of quotes from Amazon Kindle's "My Clippings". Kindle generates a file called "My Clippings" with a list of author, date and quote that was saved when using the Kindle. Copying quotes from a certain book using this document was slow so I decided to write a Python script that lists all the quotes for a selected book, so that I can quickly copy the output and save in a document or on my website.
